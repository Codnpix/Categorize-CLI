# Categorizer
> A simple program made using Python to automate files from a specific folder.

## Todo

1) Make more categories like kind, extension, size, or date to organise the files in folders
2) Organize files based on both year created, month created 
if some files belong to the same year make a folder with that year then inside that folder make a folder with that month then move all the files corresponding to that year and month into that folder
3) Organize files based on just year
if some files belong to the same year make a folder with that year then move all the files with that year into that folder
